# image_optimization_for_web
A SPA site for users to optimize their images for the web as well as create thumbnails 


The goal of this is to make it easier for non-software engineers to have access to image optimization tools such as imagemin as well as imagemagik for their blogs or other content management. 

##  Requirements

Highly reccomend using a Linux based operating environment. There is a bug with one of the dependencies of imagmin that prevents it from working on Windows development environments. (something with one of the JPEG libraries)

NodeJs installed (Recomend to use NVM)
Bowerand Gulp installed globally. 

## installation

1. clone the repo
2. npm install
3. bower install (it will load dependencies into the correct directory)
4. npm start to run. 
5. access at localhost:5000/ and enjoy
